# CentralLimitTheorem

Overview


This project focuses on testing the Central Limit Theorem using a uniform distribution. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution. Here, we generate a sample from a uniform distribution, calculate its mean and variance, and then explore the distribution of sample means and sample variances.

Workflow

TESTING THEORITICAL MEAN, VARIANCE AND SAMPLING DIST SAMPLE MEAN AND VARIANCE FOR UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION


### FIRST GENERATE A SAMPLE UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION
### CALCULATE ITS MEAN AND VARIANCE
### THEN DISTRIBUTE IT INTO SETS OF UNIFORM SAMPLES AND CALCULATE THE SAMPLE MEANS 
### CALCULATE THE COMBINED MEAN AND COMBINED VARIANCE OF SAMPLE MEANS

Conclusion


By following this workflow, the project aims to demonstrate how the Central Limit Theorem manifests in the distribution of sample means and sample variances from a uniform distribution. The analysis provides insights into the behavior of the theorem and its application in practical scenarios.
