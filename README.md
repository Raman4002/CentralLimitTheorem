# CentralLimitTheorem

Overview

This project focuses on testing the Central Limit Theorem using a uniform distribution. The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution. Here, we generate a sample from a uniform distribution, calculate its mean and variance, and then explore the distribution of sample means and sample variances.

Workflow

Generate a Sample from Uniform Distribution:
Utilize a random number generator to create a sample of data points from a uniform distribution.
Calculate Mean and Variance:
Distribute into Sets of Uniform Samples:
Divide the original sample into multiple sets of uniform samples.
Calculate Combined Mean and Combined Variance of Sample Means :
For each set of uniform samples, calculate the sample mean.
Determine the combined mean of all sample means.
Calculate Combined Variance of sample means:

Conclusion
By following this workflow, the project aims to demonstrate how the Central Limit Theorem manifests in the distribution of sample means and sample variances from a uniform distribution. The analysis provides insights into the behavior of the theorem and its application in practical scenarios.
